      Instructions when generating python code:

      - Follow PEP 8
      - Use 4 spaces for indentation
      - Use clear, descriptive names
      - Include type hints for parameters and returns
      - Use the latest type hint syntax (e.g. `list` instead of `List`, `| None` instead of `Optional`, etc.)
      - Use docstrings in the format below when creating functions:
          ```python
          def function(param: type) -> return_type:
              """
              Brief description.
              
              Args:
                  param: description
                  
              Raises:
                  Exception: description
              """
          ```
      - Avoid unnecessary comments but include comments for non-trivial code
      - Handle errors with specific exceptions
      - Use pytest when applicable or asked to write tests
      - Use f-strings for formatting
      - Include example usage in docstrings for non-trivial functions
      - Give a brief overview of the code generated.

    text: "When suggesting updates to code, show only the specific lines or sections that need to be added, removed, or modified. Avoid regenerating entire functions or classes unless the majority of the code has changed and it's clearer to rewrite than to explain. For each change, explain exactly where the change needs to be made and keep the explanation concise and focused."

    name: "Intuitive Explanations"
    text: |
      Provide explanations that seamlessly blend intuitive, accessible language with precise technical details. If the text or topic contains mathematical equations that are important to learning the material explain the equations and how they relate to the topic.  Break down complex ideas into clear, digestible steps. Include key takeaways, critical points, and underlying principles. Anticipate potential points of confusion and proactively address them. Despite providing intuitive explanations, do not shy away from the details, and provide all information necessary to learn and understand the material or question. Try to avoid short bullets (unless applicable) and favor sentences with completion explanations.

# Welcome to Chat

Start a new conversation by typing a message below.

Press `Enter` to send a message, `Shift+Enter` for a new line. `Command | Cntl` + `N` starts a new conversation (or `+` icon in History).

You can:
* Generate responses from multiple models by selecting models from either the `Model Configurations` section or the "attachment" section by the `Send` button
* Attach one or more `contexts` or `instructions`
* Use pre-defined prompts

---

## Model Configurations

A model configuration specifies a model (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`) along with various parameters (e.g. `temperature`).

Rather than selecting a single model to use, you can create and attach multiple model configurations to a chat.

---

## Contexts

A `context` represents the information that the model be given. Contexts can specify instructions, files, and so on. Different model types (e.g. `code` context vs `learning` context) use the information in slightly different ways.

---

## Prompts

Prompts are predefined instructions for the LLM for a specific usecase like summarizations. 

---

## Instructions

`Instructions` are predefined text given to the model that give it insight into how it should respond. For example, instructions can specify that the model should give intuitive explanations, or can specify various characteristics of the code that is generated (e.g. libraries to prefer).
